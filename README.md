A fun app to select GIF files from GIPHY.com, on topics entered by the user.
Version 0.0 -- repository created, placeholder files for style.css, app.js, and index.html created. no code or html content yet.
Version 0.1 -- code to load topics and favorites from local storage completed and tested, also the code to render search buttons from the list of topic is complete and working. Index.html mostly complete, still has some controls to add. css tyles started.
Version 0.2 -- added drop-down lists so that user may select the rating and limit of gifs returned by search.

NEXT TO DO: 1) implement code to make ajax call to GIPHY  API, and display results.
2) add controls to enable user to clear the search results section.
3) implement double-click on a gif image to add it to favorites.
4) implement double-click on a favorite gif to remove it from favorites
5) implement right-click to delete a topic button and its associated local storage key.
6) implement code to delete all local storage entries for favorites and topics, since those get re-written in the course of the app's operation.
